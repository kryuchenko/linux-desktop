# Linux Desktop with Gaming Stack

Run a hardware accelerated KDE desktop with comprehensive gaming support in a container. This is a fork of [ai-dock/linux-desktop](https://github.com/ai-dock/linux-desktop) enhanced with gaming and creative tools.

## Features

This image extends the base ai-dock/linux-desktop with:

### Gaming Components
- **Wine (Staging)** - Windows compatibility layer
- **Lutris** - Game launcher and manager
- **Proton GE 10-3** - Custom Proton build for enhanced game compatibility
- **Protontricks** - Tool for managing Proton prefixes
- **GameMode** - Automatic performance optimization for games
- **MangoHud** - Vulkan/OpenGL overlay for monitoring performance
- **Vulkan drivers** - Full 32-bit and 64-bit support

### Creative & Productivity Tools
- **LibreOffice** - Full office suite with KDE integration
- **Blender 4.2.0** - 3D creation suite
- **Krita 5.2.3** - Digital painting application
- **GIMP** - Image manipulation program
- **Inkscape** - Vector graphics editor
- **Google Chrome** - Web browser

### Custom Scripts
- `proton-run` - Easy execution of Windows .exe files
- `proton-ge` - Proton GE wrapper
- `protontricks` - Protontricks wrapper

This image is based on [Selkies Project](https://github.com/selkies-project) to provide an accelerated desktop environment for NVIDIA, AMD and Intel machines.

## Documentation

All AI-Dock containers share a common base which is designed to make running on cloud services such as [vast.ai](https://link.ai-dock.org/vast.ai) as straightforward and user friendly as possible.

Common features and options are documented in the [base wiki](https://github.com/ai-dock/base-image/wiki) but any additional features unique to this image will be detailed below.

  -p 6100:6100 \
  -p 1111:1111 \
  -e WEB_USER=user \
  -e WEB_PASSWORD=password \
  kryuchenko/linux-desktop:latest-cuda

# For AMD GPUs
docker run -it --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri \
  -p 6100:6100 \
  -p 1111:1111 \
  -e WEB_USER=user \
  -e WEB_PASSWORD=password \
  kryuchenko/linux-desktop:latest-rocm
